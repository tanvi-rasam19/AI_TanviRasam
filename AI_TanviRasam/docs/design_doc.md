# Design Document

## Thought Process
- Knowledge Graph = structured way to store and retrieve concepts.
- AI/LLM = generate slides + scripts automatically.
- Formatter = makes slides look clean and structured.
- Manim = best for animations of math/algorithms.
- Backend = orchestrates all steps.

## Trade-offs
- Knowledge Graph setup is extra work but very efficient later.
- AI may produce mistakes â†’ needs validation.
- Manim is powerful but has learning curve.
- Microservices add complexity but help scalability.
