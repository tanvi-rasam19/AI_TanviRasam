# AI-Powered Knowledge Graph to Manim Automation

## Problem
Students need an easy way to learn concepts. Making videos manually takes time.

## Solution
- Knowledge Graph → find concepts  
- AI → make slides and scripts  
- Formatter → structure content  
- Manim → create animations  
- Backend → connect everything  
- Storage → save videos  

## Files
- diagrams/architecture.png → system diagram  
- pseudo_code/workflow.md → pseudocode  
- docs/design_doc.md → thought process & trade-offs  
- code/main.py → simple demo code
